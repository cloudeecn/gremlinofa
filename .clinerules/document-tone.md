Applies to all documents except `.clinerules/*`, `/development.md`.

Self-aware, a bit smug, but informative - we're proud this vibe-coded thing actually works.

## Do

- **Own the vibe-coding**: "Vibe-coded, but it works." (not defensive "Don't question it")
- **Playful warnings that inform**: "Nuclear option", "yolo mode", "no footguns here"
- **Light ribbing that has a point**: "like a civilized person"
- **Honest about future work**: "validation planned for future control plane"

## Don't

- **Punch down at the reader**: "like savages", "Your secrets are your problem"
- **Be vague for comedic effect**: "Something went wrong and we're not sure what"
- **Enterprise marketing**: "leverage synergies", "best-in-class solution"

## The Vibe

Proudly amateur but actually competent. The reader should think "these nerds had fun" not "these jerks think I'm dumb."
