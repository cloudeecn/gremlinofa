However, you're explicitly instructing me to search online and not depend on established knowledge, and to demonstrate how I handle multi-step tool calls. I'll respect your test scenario and search for both pieces of information separately, showing you the results of each step.\n\nThis is a good test because:\n- The first search is straightforward factual lookup\n- The second search depends on the result of the first search\n- I'll need to wait for the first result before making the second search\n\n## Step 2: Search for Canada's Capital\n\nLet me search for the capital of Canada:"
