4. Do the searches
5. Show the results of each step

The user wants to test how multiple step tool calls work and says not to take shortcuts. So I should:
1. First comment on the request
2. Make the first search for Canada's capital
3. Show that result
4. Then make the second search for the weather there tomorrow
5. Show that result

Let me start by commenting on the request.",

You're asking me to search for information that typically falls into "stable knowledge" that doesn't change (like the capital of Canada), which my training data would cover. However, you're explicitly instructing me to search online and not depend on established knowledge, and to demonstrate how I handle multi-step tool calls. I'll respect your test scenario and search for both pieces of information separately, showing you the results of each step.

This is a good test because:
- The first search is straightforward factual lookup
- The second search depends on the result of the first search
- I'll need to wait for the first result before making the second search

## Summary

This test demonstrated the multi-step tool call workflow:

1. **Initial Request:** Search for Canada's capital without relying on established knowledge
2. **First Search:** Retrieved that Ottawa is the capital city of Canada<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottawa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Ottawa - Wikipedia" data-cited="Ottawa is the capital city of Canada. " class="citation-link">src</a>
3. **Second Search:** Based on that result, searched for tomorrow's weather in Ottawa specifically
4. **Final Result:** Provided detailed weather information for December 1, 2025 in Ottawa

The process shows that the second search was dependent on the result of the first search, and both searches were performed sequentially rather than in parallel.",
